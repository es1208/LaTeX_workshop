\subsection{Standard zircon KIM-5}
Each zircon mount contained a 0.5 to 1.0 mm chip of oxygen isotope standard zircon KIM-5. 
The chips were obtained from a single cm-size kimberlite megacryst zircon from Kimberley, South Africa, with a $\delta^{18}O$ value of $5.09\pm0.06\permil$ \citep{valley03, valley01}.
Fifteen age determinations by SHRIMP II were made on two chips of KIM-5 (Fig. 1a).
The data were reduced with SQUID \citep{ludwig01a} and plotted using Isoplot/Ex \citep{ludwig01b}. 
The $^{206}$Pb/$^{238}$U ages corrected for common Pb using both $^{204}$Pb measured values ($88\pm11$ Ma, 2$\sigma$) and  $^{208}$Pb-corrected values ($92\pm3$ Ma, 2$\sigma$) are indistinguishable within error.
